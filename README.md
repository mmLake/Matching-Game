# Matching-Game
A Matching Game I created in Intro to Programs and Problem Solving.
There are 16 cards faced down, with 8 pairs of Symbols on the face of the card. 
The User will pick 2 cards, and the game will be completed once all the cards have been matched up.  
The game will also display the number of turns you took to complete the game at the end.
